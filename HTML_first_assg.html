<!-- Your final project is to create a web page that matches the example given here. Your page must match mine exactly other than the title and any parts that have been highlighted in yellow.

The assignment will be graded based on the presence of all the required tags. Specifically the grading rubric questions will be

Was the doctype included correctly? (<!DOCTYPE html>)
Is there a head tag with a title for the page?
Is there a body tag?
Is there a nag tag with four anchor tags inside? Did they remember to change the text for the fourth link?
Is the Favorite Foods section complete with an h2 heading and four unordered list items?
Is the Achievements section complete with an h2 heading and three progress bars?
Is the More About Me section complete with an h2 heading and a details and summary tag?
Is the image correctly linked?
Is the link to intro-webdesign working?
Does everything else on the page appear to be where it belongs? -->
